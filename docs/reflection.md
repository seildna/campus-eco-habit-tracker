# Reflection: GitHub and Project Planning

## What I learned
I learned how to break one assignment into small, trackable tasks and map each task to GitHub issues, feature branches, and pull requests. I also practiced writing clear commit messages that show progress instead of pushing one large commit.

## Most interesting part
The most interesting part was seeing how project planning and coding connect. When issues were clearly written, implementation became easier because each commit had a clear goal.

## Most challenging part
The most challenging part was keeping branch history clean while still making meaningful incremental commits. It required planning the order of changes before coding.

## If I had more time
If I had more time, I would add:
- A dashboard chart for weekly trend comparison.
- A campus map showing recycling stations.
- Team mode for student groups to run sustainability challenges together.
